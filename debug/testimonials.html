        <blockquote>
          <h2>Bonnie Doran</h2>
          <p>“Bruce has been representing me and my family for many years. If we have any legal problems or need legal advice we contact him. He has been more than just an attorney and he really is concerned for a client’s well being. I refer anyone that has legal issues to Bruce because I am confident he will help them as much as he can possibly can. His ability to practice in different areas of law allows my family to keep all our legal matters under one roof.”</p>
        </blockquote>

          <h2>John J. Shutey, III</h2>
          <h3>The Melting Pot</h3>
          <p>Marc Reisman has been an integral part of my restaurant’s success from the beginning. His knowledge of the restaurant industry and the complicated State system of regulation has always enabled me to focus on what is important to me – my business. With his professionalism and attention to detail, I have one less aspect of my business to worry about. I highly recommend Marc to anyone who is looking to retain a knowledgeable and experienced liquor licensing lawyer. He has given us more than nine years of seamless operation with the State and that is well worth his affordable fees.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
          <h2>Hagan Smith</h2>
          <p>“Bruce has been providing legal representation and counseling to me and my family for over 20 years. His ability to provide advice in a number of areas of law has greatly assisted me in with my personal and business affairs, ranging from the drafting and review of contracts and legal documents to courtroom litigation and real estate issues. Bruce provides a personal touch which I really appreciate - it makes me feel more at ease than if it were strictly a business relationship.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <h2>Steve Zumoff</h2>
          <h3>Double Wide Grill</h3>
          <p>“We’ve been using Marc’s services for liquor licensing matters since 1996.  We’re impressed by his knowledge of the law, and his responsiveness. We give him the highest recommendation.  We also appreciate the fact that Gelman & Reisman is able to handle other legal matters for us, both business and personal.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <h2>Kevin Craig</h2>
          <p>“You guys did a fantastic job on my bicycle accident case. The two of you exceeded my expectations in your detailed knowledge of the applicable law, your persistence, your analysis of both my case and the defendant’s arguments, and your handling of settlement negotiations. I couldn’t be more pleased.”</p> 
        </blockquote>
        
        <blockquote>
          <h2>Richard Katz</h2>
          <p>"When I found myself with serious injuries from an accident that turned my world upside down, Gelman & Reisman were there to stand by my side. They're not like the lawyers one would think in the traditional sense, not like the law firms that are only out for themselves, they truly care about your well being, they treat you more like family than a client. Marc and Bruce are skilled at finding avenues of reparation above what I expected, and I couldn't have been more satisfied with the results. I truly consider them friends, and not just lawyers, as they have changed my perception of the lawyer stereotype. Gelman & Reisman, I could not recommend a better law firm.”</p>
