      p — "When I found myself with serious injuries from an accident that turned my world upside down, Gelman & Reisman were there to stand by my side. They're not like the lawyers one would think in the traditional sense, not like the law firms that are only out for themselves, they truly care about your well being, they treat you more like family than a client. Marc and Bruce are skilled at finding avenues of reparation above what I expected, and I couldn't have been more satisfied with the results. I truly consider them friends, and not just lawyers, as they have changed my perception of the lawyer stereotype. Gelman & Reisman, I could not recommend a better law firm.”
